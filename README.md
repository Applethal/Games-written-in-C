# cnake


The game is turn based because I still have to figure out how to make it run at real time. The snake is represented by `1` while its food is represented by `2`. ~~I made it so that the game runs only on grids that are bigger than 2 x 2.~~ The game's board is set to 20 x 20 to avoid having users give a large custom number or inputting a `char` for the dimensions.  
~~Moving the snake extends its length even when not picking up the food, I have to find a way around fixing this piece of logic. For now I just marked every valid path with 1.~~
