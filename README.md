# cnake


The game is turn based because I still have to figure out how to make it run at real time. The snake is represented by `1` while its food is represented by `2`. I made it so that the game runs only on grids that are bigger than 2 x 2. 
Moving the snake extends its length even when not picking up the food, I have to find a way around fixing this piece of logic. For now I just marked every valid path with 1.
